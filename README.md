<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

* We are trying to create an Open-Source Desktop application to **handle and process Google Maps' API geo-spatial data**.


### Built With
* [Java](https://www.java.com/it/)
* [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html)
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation?hl=it)


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
* UNTIL NOW YOU CAN:
    * Enter an origin address 
    * Enter something you wanto to look for near you
    * The application will query Google Maps' API and return a map with all the possibile destination and their relative road path
    ![](res/searchAndSeeRes_Trim.gif)
    * You can highlight a path by passing with the mouse on it's relative destination
    ![](res/HooverExample_1.gif)
    * Although zooming in and out is a thing, these have to be slightly bug-fixed
