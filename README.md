<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

* We are trying to create an Open-Source Desktop application to **handle and process Google Maps' API geo-spatial data**.


### Built With
* [Java](https://www.java.com/it/)
* [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html)
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation?hl=it)


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
* UNTIL NOW YOU CAN:
    * Enter an origin address.
    * Enter something you want to look for near you.
    * The application will query Google Maps' API and return a map image with all the possible destinations and their relative road path.

    * You can highlight a path by passing with the mouse on it's relative destination

    * Although zooming in and out is a thing, these have to be slightly bug-fixed
